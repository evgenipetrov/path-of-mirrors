"""Repository interfaces for upstream bounded context.

This module defines repository protocols for storing upstream data snapshots.
The upstream context handles integration with external data sources.

Planned scope:
- Snapshot repository protocol for raw API responses
- League repository protocol for active/historical leagues
- Will be implemented when background ingestion is added

Status: Not yet implemented (placeholder for Phase 1)
"""


# Repository interfaces will be defined here when data ingestion is implemented.
# Currently, upstream services (providers, trade API client) operate without persistence.
