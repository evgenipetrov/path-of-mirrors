"""PostgreSQL repository implementations for upstream bounded context.

This module provides concrete PostgreSQL implementations for upstream data storage.
The upstream context handles integration with external data sources.

Planned scope:
- Snapshot repository for storing raw poe.ninja/trade API responses
- League repository for tracking active and historical leagues
- Will be implemented when background ingestion is added

Status: Not yet implemented (placeholder for Phase 1)
"""


# Repository implementations will be defined here when data ingestion is implemented.
# Currently, upstream services (providers, trade API client) operate without persistence.
